"""Wave 3 — minors, heat breaks as evidence, cohort training, and bin sealing.

Four items out of `fafo_ios/SERVER_CHANGES.md`, and unlike wave 1 they are not
four instances of one failure. Three of them are places where the SERVER knew
something and threw it away at the moment it mattered; the fourth is a register
that did not exist at all.

FIVE CLAIMS.

1. `WhoIsUnderEighteen` — item 15. `is_minor` is DERIVED from `date_of_birth` on
   every read and stored nowhere, it is THREE-VALUED, and the two age bands have
   different ceilings. The negative controls are the load-bearing tests here: an
   adult is unaffected by every one of these rules, and a worker with no date of
   birth on file reads as `None` rather than as an adult — which is the failure a
   boolean column would have shipped.

2. `WhatAMinorMayNotDo` — item 15 (c) to (f). The hour and clock ceilings refuse
   at `add_worker_to_shift` and merely REPORT at `start_shift`; the prohibited
   task types refuse at `assign_farm_task`; and the weekly ceiling raises a
   compliance alert before the week ends rather than after.

3. `AHeatBreakCarriesTheHeat` — item 17. A break logged as Cool-Down, Water Break
   or Shade Break carries the shift's peak temperature, its peak heat index, the
   moment the threshold was crossed and the provenance of the reading. A Paid
   Rest carries none of it, which is the negative control that proves the stamp
   is keyed on the KIND rather than on the presence of a timeline.

4. `OneAfternoonNotElevenCards` — item 4. Several people lapsing on one
   `group_training` curriculum become ONE Training Session with all of them as
   attendees. One person does not. A curriculum that is not ticked does not.
   Running the sweep twice raises nothing the second time.

5. `TheBinTracesBackToTheCrew` — item 23. The whole register: sealing, the
   retry that must not double a count, the two counts that are allowed to
   disagree, and `trace_bin` — including the reused tag, which is the case a
   uniqueness constraint would have got wrong in the expensive direction.
