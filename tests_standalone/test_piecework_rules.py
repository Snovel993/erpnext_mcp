"""Piecework and hours — the pay rules, tested as scenarios a foreman would recognise.

`test_payroll.py` tests the engine's functions one at a time and
`test_payroll_integration.py` tests the join from the shift register to the
slip. Neither walks a WHOLE DAY of picking end to end and asserts the dollar
figure, and neither pins the three places where what the code does and what a
reader assumes it does come apart. That is what this file is for.

v0.48.2 wrote this file to pin four places where the code and a reader's
assumption came apart. v0.49.0 closed all four, and every test that asserted a
gap is now the test that asserts it is shut. What follows is what the rules ARE.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE HIGHER-OF RULE IS APPLIED AND THE MAKEUP IS NAMED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Ask most people how piecework pay works and they will say "the greater of the
piece total and minimum wage for the hours", and that is now what this app does.
FLSA §6, ORS 653.025 and RCW 49.46.020 all make the minimum wage a floor under
the WAGE: piece rate is a way of measuring pay, never a way to earn less than
the hours were worth. Forty-seven buckets at $1.50 in an eight-hour Oregon day
pays $117.60 — $70.50 earned and $47.10 of `minimum_wage_makeup`.

THE MAKEUP IS ITS OWN FIGURE, and that is the half of the old posture worth
keeping. Through v0.48.2 the shortfall was reported and gross was left alone,
precisely so a rate set below the lawful floor would stay visible. Folding the
top-up silently into gross would have lost that, so it is not folded in: it is a
field on the slip, a column on the stored row, and `topped_up_to_minimum_wage` at
the top of the run summary. `TheHigherOfRuleIsApplied` pins both halves — the
worker is paid, and the rate is still on somebody's screen.

THE FLOOR CARRIES THE OVERTIME PREMIUM. A picker who works fifty hours has a
statutory floor of forty at straight time plus ten at one and a half: $588 plus
$220.50 is $808.50, not the flat $735. Four hundred buckets at $1.50 earns $660
over those fifty hours, so the day pays $808.50. `OvertimeUnderPieceRate` pins
the floor, the $148.50 of makeup, and the fact that omitting the overtime split
from the check is what used to produce the passing verdict.

THE PIECE OVERTIME PREMIUM IS HALF-TIME, NOT TIME AND A HALF. 29 CFR 778.111:
the regular rate is straight-time earnings over hours worked, and the piece
earnings ALREADY paid straight time for the overtime hours — so what is owed on
top is one half of the regular rate. Through v0.48.2 this app paid the full 1.5x
on top, which is more than the law asks and could not be reconciled with the
weighted-average method a mixed day needs.

OVERTIME IS WEEKLY, SO A TEN-HOUR DAY IS NOT OVERTIME. Both states put the ag
threshold at forty hours in a workweek and neither has a daily one. Ten hours on
Tuesday is ten straight-time hours; the premium starts wherever the fortieth hour
of that week falls, which may be Friday morning.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AND A WORKER CAN NOW BE PART PIECE-RATE AND PART HOURLY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

`pay_type` was one field on one salary structure, so a picker who spent the
morning on buckets and the afternoon on irrigation was paid the piece rate for
the afternoon — which is to say nothing, because irrigation produces no buckets.
A shift or a crew row now carries its own `pay_type` and `pay_rate`, blank on the
ordinary day, and the engine pays each stretch its own way and blends ONE regular
rate across them for the premium (29 CFR 778.115). Six hours of picking at $1.50
a bucket and two of irrigation at $16.00 is $167, and the floor is tested on all
eight hours. `MixedPieceworkAndHourlyWork` walks it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
EIGHT CLAIMS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. `TheHigherOfRuleIsApplied` — the two scenarios, the boundary between them,
   zero buckets, Washington's higher floor and Portland's, and the makeup named
   on the slip and in the run summary.
2. `OvertimeUnderPieceRate` — a ten-hour day is not overtime; a fifty-hour week
   is; the piece premium is half the effective hourly; and the floor for those
   fifty hours is $808.50, which is what the worker is paid.
3. `BucketsBecomePieceUnits` — accepted Bucket Log Entries, through the real
   loader on the shipped doctype, become the piece units that become the gross.
   Rejected captures do not.
4. `MultiDayPayPeriod` — ten days across two workweeks aggregate into one slip
   with the hours, the units and the overtime each summed the way they are
   counted, not the way they would total.
5. `PieceworkEdgeCases` — zero buckets, a partial shift, an unclosed shift, and
   a paid rest break on a piece-rate day.
6. `MixedPieceworkAndHourlyWork` — the mixed day, end to end, with the rate from
   the shift and from the structure, and the floor over both segments.
7. `TheTwoMinimumWageVerdicts` — the flat check and the per-state check on one
   cross-state slip, and what each says now that Washington's hours are paid up
   to Washington's floor.
8. `TheBucketReconciliation` — `get_piecework_summary` and
   `reconcile_bucket_payroll`, which until v0.48.2 had no test but their name in
   the registry.
