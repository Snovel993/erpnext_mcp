"""Where a generated document goes: onto a record, and — carefully — onto disk.

TWO DESTINATIONS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS THE DELIVERABLE. A generated report's
durable home is a private File attached to a Governance Document: permissioned,
version-tracked, backed up with the site, and readable through
`get_attachment_content` with the same permission check every other attachment
gets. `output_path` is the second destination, and it exists for one reason — a
batch of thirty 1099 forms that somebody has to print is thirty round trips
through base64 otherwise.

THE FILESYSTEM RULE, AND WHY IT IS THIS STRICT. A tool that writes to an
arbitrary path is a tool that can write anywhere the bench user can: into
`sites/*/site_config.json`, into an app's source tree, over a backup. So the
allowed area is exactly the two directories a Frappe site already treats as file
storage — `<site>/private/files` and `<site>/public/files` — and everything else
is refused, naming the roots. A relative path lands under `private/files`. A
symlink cannot be used to escape, because the check is on the *resolved* real
path, not the one that was typed. And an existing file is never overwritten
unless the caller says so, because the most likely thing at a path a report
generator was pointed at twice is last quarter's report.

Nothing here decides *whether* a file may be written. That is the tool switch,
and the dispatcher has already asked.
