"""The file of court orders this employer has been served with.

WHAT THIS IS AND WHAT `payroll_deductions.py` IS. A Farm Payroll Deduction is a
standing instruction — take this much, from this date, under this ceiling. That
is everything a payroll run needs and nothing a court needs. A Farm Garnishment
is the ORDER: the case number, who issued it, when the employer was served, what
the whole debt is, how much of it has been collected, and the letter that went
back saying withholding had begun.

ONE CALL FILES BOTH. `create_garnishment` inserts the order and then creates its
deduction THROUGH `create_payroll_deduction` — the same writer, the same
allowlist, the same duplicate refusal, the same category-to-law mapping. A
second deduction writer here would be a second place for the CCPA ceilings to be
got wrong, and the ceilings are the whole of what makes this defensible.

WHICH SWITCH GOVERNS THAT. `allow_create_garnishment`, and only that one.
Filing an order and instructing payroll to honour it are one act — an operator
who enabled the first and got a record that withholds nothing would have a
garnishment on the file that the payroll run cannot see, which is the failure
this doctype exists to prevent. The tool says so in its own description rather
than leaving an operator to infer it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE PRIORITY FIELD IS NOT THE ENGINE'S PRIORITY FIELD
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Federal precedence is child support 1, tax levy 2, student loan 3, creditor 4,
and the doctype derives it from the type on every save. The payroll engine sorts
by the DEDUCTION's category — 10, 20, 30, 40 — and `_deduction_payload` passes
no priority at all so the category speaks. Pushing 1..4 across would put a
creditor order at 4 ahead of a support order at 10 and invert the exact
precedence the field records. The two sequences agree about the order and
disagree about the integers; this module is where that is known.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT STOPS THE MONEY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

`total_withheld` is the running sum of what payroll actually took, which is less
than what the order asked for on any period where a ceiling bound. When it
reaches `total_owed` the controller sets the status to Satisfied and its
`on_update` retires the linked deduction. Withholding past a satisfied judgment
is money taken under an authority that has expired, and it is the employer that
took it.

A ZERO `total_owed` IS NOT A SATISFIED DEBT. It is a field nobody filled in, and
every child support order is one — an ongoing obligation with no principal to run
down. The arithmetic only runs where a balance exists; see the controller.
