"""Who owns this, what happened to their interest, and which paper says so.

Three doctypes and ten tools, and one idea holding them together: **the ledger
stays anonymous and the register carries the names**.

WHY THAT SPLIT. A chart of accounts and a cost center tree are read by everyone
who touches the books — a bookkeeper, a lender, an auditor, a model summarising
the year. Family names sitting in either one leak into every report that is
exported, and cannot be taken out again once a statement has been sent. So a
posting is tagged with an anonymous Member accounting dimension value
(`Member-01`), and exactly one place on the site — the Cap Table Entry — maps
that value to a legal entity, an admission date and a percentage. Anyone who
needs the mapping can be given read access to one doctype; nobody needs it to
read the ledger.

WHY THE COST CENTER IS OPTIONAL AND THE DIMENSION IS NOT. Members are a
*dimension*, not a segment of the business: cost centers answer "which part of
the operation did this belong to", and a member is not a part of the operation.
The Cap Table Entry keeps a `member_cost_center` field anyway, because a site
whose convention already gives each member a cost center should not have to
abandon it — but every tool here files by the dimension, and the cost center is
carried along rather than relied upon.

WHY EVERY EVENT HAS A NARRATIVE, AND IT IS MANDATORY. A Journal Entry survives
on its own. The reason for it does not: "why did Member-02 take 40,000 in March
2031" is the question that is asked once the people who knew have gone. So
`record_member_event` refuses an event without one, in the same way
`cancel_journal_entry` refuses a cancellation without a reason.

WHAT THESE TOOLS DO NOT DO. They do not submit anything. A member event that
needs a Journal Entry gets a DRAFT one, exactly as `create_journal_entry` does,
and posting it is `submit_member_event` — which checks the *submit_journal_entry*
switch as well as its own, because posting to the general ledger is a permission
an operator grants once, in one place, whatever route reaches it.
