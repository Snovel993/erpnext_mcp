"""The badge in a worker's own wallet. One tool. v0.53.0.

`generate_employee_badge_pass` is `generate_employee_badge_qr` with a different
delivery: same register row, same minted `CFL-0001`, same QR payload, wrapped in
an Apple Wallet `.pkpass` file and a Google Wallet save link instead of a PNG to
print. The foreman finishes onboarding, hits this, and AirDrops the file to the
worker standing in front of them — it opens straight into Wallet with no app to
install on the worker's side, which is the whole reason this exists rather than
a second handset app.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IT DELEGATES THE BADGE. IT DOES NOT HAVE ITS OWN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The identifier, the minting, the register row and the retirement of a replaced
card are `badges.py`'s, called here through the same two functions
`generate_employee_badge_qr` uses — `_choose_badge_id` then `_record_badge`. So
this tool is IDEMPOTENT in exactly the same way: somebody who already holds a
live badge gets a pass for THAT badge rather than a second identifier, and
`regenerate=true` is the lost-card path that mints one and retires the old.

That is not code-sharing for its own sake. A worker with a printed card and a
wallet pass is holding TWO copies of one badge, and the moment those could
diverge is the moment a bucket scanned off the phone pays somebody the card
does not. There is one identifier and both artefacts render it.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT IS WRITTEN, AND THE ONE FILE THAT IS REPLACED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The `.pkpass` is attached PRIVATELY to the Employee, named `badge-<badge_id>.pkpass`.
Regenerating replaces THAT file — matched on the exact generated name, on that
Employee, and on the `.pkpass` extension, so nothing else attached to the record
can be caught by it. The alternative is an attachment list that grows one file
every time a foreman presses the button on a bad connection, all of them
identical except the one that is current.

The pass is a DERIVED artefact and the register row is the record. Losing the
File loses nothing — this tool rebuilds it byte-identically from the same badge
(see `wallet.zip_pass` on why the archive is deterministic).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AN UNSIGNED PASS IS RETURNED AND SAID TO BE UNSIGNED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

A site with no Apple certificate configured gets a complete, correct, UNSIGNED
`.pkpass` and a result that says `apple.signed: false` with the reason and the
`site_config.json` keys in it. Wallet will refuse to open that file. This is
deliberate and is argued in `wallet.py`'s header: the honest failure is one an
operator can act on, and a self-signed blob with a `signature` member in it
fails identically while looking upstream like it worked.

So the feature ships complete and inert, and it becomes live the day a
certificate lands in `site_config.json` — no code change. `docs/wallet-passes.md`
is what Tim needs to obtain and where to put it.
