"""Producing an audit packet, and filing it where it can be found again.

THE PACKET IS A DOCUMENT, NOT A RESULT. `generate_compliance_packet` returns its
payload inline, because a reconciliation packet is a value somebody reads once.
An audit packet is a thing that gets printed, carried into a room, and produced
again in two years when the same auditor asks what happened. So it is rendered to
a PDF, attached to a Governance Document in the company's archive, and the tool
returns forty characters of file_url rather than a megabyte of base64 — which is
also the only way it fits inside the per-call ceiling.

PDF IS THE DEFAULT AND DOCX IS AVAILABLE. That order is deliberate and was
learned rather than chosen: a .docx handed to somebody who cannot open it is a
document that did not arrive, which happened on 2026-07-29 and is why
`generate_quarterly_investment_report` defaults the same way.

IDEMPOTENCE IS BY (audit_type, company, period). A second call for the same three
is refused unless `overwrite=true`, because the most likely thing at that
coordinate is the packet somebody produced last week — and two packets for one
audit period, differing in whatever changed in between, is a question nobody wants
to be asked.

THE KAIROTIC GATE LIVES IN `audit_packets.readiness` and is a REFUSAL. A packet
asserts a compliant period; an open corrective action inside that period
contradicts the assertion, and a warning at the top of a printed document is not
read by the person the document is handed to. Overriding is possible, awkward, and
puts the open items in a section at the FRONT.

`stage_via_chunks` ROUTES THE ASSEMBLED BYTES THROUGH THE STAGING PIPELINE, and
it is worth being straight about when that matters. The bytes never cross the MCP
boundary — this tool builds them on the site — so no chunking is needed to get
them anywhere. What staging buys is a CHECKPOINT: a worker killed between
assembling a forty-megabyte season and writing it leaves a resumable session and a
per-piece digest rather than a timeout. On a two-hundred-kilobyte packet that is
ceremony, and this tool says so in the result rather than pretending otherwise.
