"""W-4 / federal withholding tools.

v0.28.0. Structured W-4 processing and the withholding engine that reads it.

The W-4 superseding pattern: a new W-4 for the same employee + tax_year sets
the old one to Superseded with a superseded_by link. Only one Active W-4 per
employee per tax_year.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
v0.48.0: THE EMPLOYER HALF, AND THE FORM ITSELF
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FOUR RELEASES COLLECTED THE ELECTIONS AND NONE OF THEM PRODUCED THE FORM. The
same gap `render_i9_pdf` closed for the I-9 in v0.47.1: what an employer keeps
for an employee's withholding is Form W-4, and what this app could produce was a
Desk print of a doctype. `render_w4_pdf` fills the IRS's own fillable PDF, which
this app now ships at `templates/w4_form.pdf`; `w4_pdf.py` is the field table
and argues its own case, including the four things it leaves deliberately blank.

AND THE FORM HAS A BLOCK THE APP HAD NOTHING FOR. Step 5's Employers Only row
asks for the employer's name and address, the first date of employment, and the
EIN. All three were on the site and none was reachable from a W-4:
`_employer_for` resolves them at render time — the employer block from I-9
Settings or the Company, exactly as Section 2 of the I-9 resolves it, and the
first date of employment from `Employee.date_of_joining`. Resolved rather than
copied onto every row, because a farm that changes its registered address should
not have a hundred W-4s carrying the old one.

WHAT IS STORED IS WHO PROCESSED IT. `submit_w4` writes `employer_signer_name`,
`employer_signer_title` and `employer_signed_at` off the authorized signer
roster — a fact about this form on this day that nothing else on the site
records, and the W-4 half of what `tools/signers.py` exists for.

	THE EMPLOYER BLOCK IS RESOLVED HERE, NOT STORED. `_employer_for` reads the
