"""The document either side of a signature: what was shown, and what was sealed.

v0.63.0. `tools/signing_evidence.py` names five steps that turn a drawn shape
into a record which survives a challenge, and says which module owns each. Two of
them had no owner:

  * STEP 1 — THE DOCUMENT WAS PRESENTED. The signer saw the form before signing
    it. `API_CONTRACT.md` §17.5 records why the app could not show them: both
    renderers answer with a private `file_url`, the handset authenticates to the
    sidecar with `X-FarmOps-Token` rather than to Frappe, and a private URL is a
    login page to it. So the app could show the COMPLETED form after signing —
    the bytes travel in `submit_form_signature`'s answer — and not the blank one
    before. `get_document_preview` is the read that closes that.

  * STEP 5 — THE ARTEFACT IS TAMPER-EVIDENT. `seal_signed_document` appends the
    verification page `pdf_seal.py` draws, hashes the finished file, and records
    the hash on the Signing Evidence rows the page describes.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHY THESE TWO ARE ONE MODULE AND NEITHER IS IN `tools/signatures.py`
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

`signatures.py` owns THE WRITE: the closed table of signable boxes, the roster
gate, the identity check, the refusal to overwrite an attestation. Neither
function here writes a signature or can — the preview is a read and the seal
runs after the ink is already on the record — and putting them there would put
two paths that must never collect a signature inside the module whose whole job
is collecting one.

What they DO share with it is the vocabulary: which doctypes are forms, how a
caller's spelling of one resolves, and which function draws each. That lives in
`signatures.FORM_HANDLERS` and `DOCTYPE_ALIASES` and is READ from here rather
than copied, so a fourth form added there is a fourth form both of these handle.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE PREVIEW IS A READ THAT WILL DRAW ONCE, AND THAT IS ARGUED FOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

`signatures._redraw` sets out at length why rendering a federal form nobody
asked for is this app deciding something that is not its to decide. The same
argument gives the answer here: a caller asking for a preview by name, in that
call, for the purpose of putting the page in front of the person about to sign
it, HAS asked. So the preview hands back the page already on the record, and
draws one only where the record has none — which on a fresh I-9 is every time,
and is the difference between this route working and it 404ing on the common
case.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO IS SILENTLY REPLACE A PAGE THAT EXISTS. `render_i9_pdf`
refuses a second render without `overwrite` because the likeliest thing in that
field is the copy somebody already printed and had signed. A preview that
re-rendered on every screen open would repoint that field a dozen times a hire
day. So a stale page is REPORTED — `stale: true`, with the record's own modified
time beside it — and refreshed only when the caller passes `refresh`.

def seal_signed_document(args: dict) -> ToolResult:
	"""Append the verification page to a signed form, hash it, and file the hash.

	STEP 5 OF THE CHAIN `tools/signing_evidence.py` OPENS WITH, and the one that
	module deferred. It runs AFTER the signature, never instead of it, and it is
	the caller's own step: `submit_form_signature` takes it automatically and
	reports what happened, and this tool is how an operator seals a form signed
	before v0.63.0 or re-seals one that has since gained a second signature.

	WHAT IT PRODUCES, in order:

	  1. THE FORM, REDRAWN. `render_i9_pdf` and `render_w4_pdf` stamp every
	     captured signature into the page CONTENT at the form's own named widget
	     rectangles and then flatten the AcroForm away — so the base document
	     already has the ink where the government put the line, and this does not
	     place a single pixel of it. A second implementation of that geometry here
	     would put the same signature in a slightly different place.
	  2. THE VERIFICATION PAGE, from the Signing Evidence rows for this document —
	     every one of them, oldest first. A Form I-9 signed by the worker in July
	     and the employer in August gets both blocks; an appendix naming one of two
	     signatures would look complete and not be.
	  3. A SHA-256 OF THE FINISHED FILE, which cannot be printed on the file it is
	     taken over — see `pdf_seal`. It goes on the evidence rows instead.
	  4. THE SEALED PDF, attached to the document. It does NOT repoint
	     `generated_pdf`: that field is the working page somebody prints, this is
	     the retained artefact, and collapsing the two would mean the next
	     signature's redraw silently threw the seal away.

	IT REFUSES AN UNSIGNED FORM, and that refusal is the point rather than
	caution. A verification page appended to a form nobody has signed is a
	document that LOOKS sealed, carries an official-sounding appendix, and vouches
	for nothing — which is worse than no page at all, because somebody would file
	it.

	A SIGNED FORM WITH NO EVIDENCE ROW IS SEALED ANYWAY, with the appendix saying
	so in as many words. Every signature collected before v0.60.0 is in that state
	and cannot grow a row retrospectively — the badge scan, the device and the

	v0.64.1, and it is a gap somebody found by looking for a completed I-9 where
	an inspection would look for it. `seal_signed_document` attached the retained
	artefact to the FORM, which is correct and was the whole of it: the personnel
	folder — the Employee record, which is what anybody opens when they are
	asked "show me this worker's paperwork" — showed nothing. The I-9 was
	complete, sealed, hashed and findable only by somebody who already knew the
	I-9 Form docname, which an auditor standing at a desk does not.

	IT IS A SECOND `File` ROW AT THE SAME `file_url`, NOT A SECOND COPY OF THE
	BYTES. `insert_attachment` writes a row pointing at a URL when it is given no
	content, which is the same door `attach_file_to_document` uses for a file that
	already lives on the site. Two links to one artefact is what a cross-reference
	is; two copies would be two documents that can drift apart, and the one thing
	a tamper-evident artefact must not do is exist twice with one hash.

	ONLY THE SEAL TRAVELS, NEVER `generated_pdf`. The working page is redrawn
	every time a signature lands, and a personnel folder accumulating a copy of
	each intermediate draw would bury the one document that matters under the
	four that were superseded. The seal is the retained artefact by construction
	— that is the argument `seal_signed_document` already makes for not
	repointing `generated_pdf` — so it is the one that gets filed.

	A FORM THAT NAMES NOBODY IS NOT AN ERROR. A Tax Form is an employer return
	signed by an officer; it has no `employee` column and belongs in no personnel
	folder. `filed: false` with the reason is the honest answer, and inventing a
	link would put a 941 in somebody's file.

	NEVER RAISES, for the reason `_record_seal` does not: the sealed artefact is
	already written and hashed by the time this runs, and a cross-reference that
	could undo it would trade the irreplaceable thing for the convenient one.

	IT IS ONLY SAFE WHERE THE DOCTYPE CAN ANSWER "IS THIS CURRENT". `_is_stale`

	column — a Tax Form — cannot say, so it is redrawn rather than trusted. Sealing

	WHY THREE COLUMNS MOVE ON A ROW THAT IS OTHERWISE IMMUTABLE
	────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

	`SigningEvidence.before_save` refuses every write after the insert, and the
	controller argues why: an evidence row that could be edited is not evidence.
	Nothing here goes through it — the three seal columns are written with
	`frappe.db.set_value(..., update_modified=False)`, the same door
	`render_i9_pdf` uses for `generated_pdf_on`, and the reason is that they are
	not part of what the row ASSERTS.

	Every other column says something about the signature: who made it, how they
	were identified, when, where, and what the document said at the time. Those
	are fixed at the moment of signing and may never move. These three say WHICH
	SEALED FILE THIS ATTESTATION CURRENTLY APPEARS IN — a fact about an artefact
	produced afterwards, and one that legitimately changes: a Form I-9 signed in
	Section 1 in July is sealed once; when the employer signs Section 2 in August
	the form is sealed again, and the July attestation now appears in a two-block
	document. Freezing the July row at the one-block file would point an auditor
	at a copy that is missing half the signatures on the form it describes.

	NOTHING IS DELETED. Each seal is a new File attached to the document, and the
	previous one stays attached — so the chain of sealed copies is itself a record,
	and the row's `sealed_pdf` names the current member of it rather than the only
	one that ever existed.

	EVERY ROW FOR THE DOCUMENT IS STAMPED, not just the newest. All of them are
	described by the page that was just drawn; a row left unstamped would say this
	attestation appears in no sealed copy, which would be false.
