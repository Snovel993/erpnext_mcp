"""Streaming uploads: move a file onto this site across as many calls as it takes.

THE PROBLEM, WHICH IS NOT THE ONE IT LOOKS LIKE. `attach_file_to_document` and
`attach_governance_document` both accept up to 8 MB of base64 in a single call.
That ceiling has never been what stopped anybody. The real ceiling is that an AI
operator has to *compose* the argument, and a base64 string lives in the tool
call it is writing — which runs out at a couple of hundred kilobytes long before
the API does. So the tool advertised 8 MB and could be handed 200 KB, and every
file-bearing operation through Sprint 5 and Sprint 6 collapsed into the same four
manual steps: Claude writes a Python script, Tim scp's it to the box, docker cp's
it into the container, docker exec's it. Per-parcel appraisal PDFs. The master
appraisal. Re-filing after a conveyance, three times. Backfilling suppliers. Tim,
2026-07-30, in one sentence: "So we don't have to run these scripts."

THE SHAPE OF THE FIX. `stage_file_chunk` takes one piece at a time and puts it in
a table. `commit_staged_file` reassembles the pieces, checks them against a hash
the caller computed before sending anything, and turns them into a File — either
attached to a document or filed as a Governance Document. `cancel_staged_upload`
throws a dead upload away. `list_staged_uploads` shows what is in flight, which
is the tool you want when call 43 of 60 fails and you need to know where to
resume.

WHY A TABLE AND NOT THE CACHE. Redis is the obvious place to stage half a file
and it is the wrong one. A 5 MB upload is a hundred round trips over some
minutes, and in that window a `bench restart`, a worker recycle or an eviction
under memory pressure throws the lot away — and the caller finds out at commit,
having spent the whole upload. Rows in a table survive every one of those.
"Restart the bench halfway through and finish the upload" is a test in this
suite, and it is the design decision the whole feature turns on.

EACH CHUNK IS THE BASE64 OF ITS OWN SLICE OF THE FILE. This is the one thing a
caller can get wrong, so it is said here, in the tool description, in the
argument description and in the refusal. Take the file's bytes, cut them into
pieces, and base64 each piece separately. Do NOT base64 the whole file and then
cut the resulting string up: the middle pieces of that are not valid base64, they
cannot be checked when they arrive, and their per-piece hashes mean nothing. The
slices need not be any particular size or a multiple of anything — the pieces are
decoded individually and their bytes concatenated in index order.

WHAT THE HASHES ARE FOR. Not security; the transport already had a bearer token.
Diagnosis. A hundred separate calls each of which said "fine" can still add up to
a file that is not the one somebody meant to send, and `expected_sha256` is the
only thing that proves otherwise. Every piece additionally records the hash of
its own bytes, so a file that fails its aggregate check can be narrowed to the
call that carried the bad piece rather than reported as "the upload is wrong".

STAGING IS TRANSIENT AND CLEANS UP AFTER ITSELF, TWICE. A session is deleted on
commit and on cancel. Sessions nobody has touched for a day are swept by
`collect_expired_sessions`, which runs on the daily scheduler AND opportunistically
at the top of every `stage_file_chunk` call. The second is the kairotic one: the
right moment to clear out abandoned uploads is when somebody is uploading, not at
three in the morning, and it means a bench with the scheduler switched off does
not quietly accumulate ninety megabytes of a PDF nobody finished sending.

OWNERSHIP. A session belongs to the user who staged its first piece. Only that
user may add to it, commit it or cancel it. This is not paranoia about other
operators; it is that two callers who happen to pick the same session id would
otherwise interleave their pieces into one corrupt file, and the failure would
look like corruption rather than like a collision.
