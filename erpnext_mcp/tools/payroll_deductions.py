"""The register of standing instructions to withhold money that is not a tax.

WHY THIS IS A REGISTER AND NOT A COLUMN ON THE SALARY STRUCTURE. A worker has
one pay rate and may have five deductions at once — a support order, a levy, a
401(k) election, a health premium and union dues — each with its own start date,
its own end date, its own reference document and its own legal rank. Columns
would cap the count and lose the dates, and the dates are the whole of what
makes a garnishment defensible: an employer answers to the court for what it
withheld and when it started withholding it.

WHY IT IS NOT A DESK-ONLY FORM. A record only reachable through the Desk cannot
be audited through MCP Action Log and cannot be included in a compliance packet.
The five tools here are the same five guards every HR tool in this app wears —
role gate, company scope, kill switch, audit row, and mutating-default-OFF.

WHAT THESE TOOLS DO NOT DO. They do not withhold anything. A row here says what
to take and from when; each payroll run reads it and decides what it can
actually take out of that period's pay, against the CCPA ceilings and in legal
priority order. The two are different numbers whenever a ceiling binds, and the
difference lands on the slip as a shortfall rather than being written back here.
`erpnext_mcp.payroll_deductions` owns the arithmetic and the statute behind each
ceiling; this module owns the file.

NOTHING HERE DELETES. `status` retires a row — Completed for an order that has
been satisfied, Suspended for one a court has stayed. A garnishment removed from
the file cannot answer the court that asks why the withholding stopped, and a
satisfied order is the record proving it was paid off.
