"""Where a set of books starts: the balances that were true before day one.

WHY THIS IS NOT JUST `create_journal_entry`. It could be, and that is the
problem. An opening balance is a journal entry with three properties a hand-built
one keeps losing:

  * **It balances against equity, not against something.** Every historical fact
    being brought onto the books — equipment transferred in, proceeds of a sale
    that happened before this ledger existed, the starting value of a portfolio —
    has a real side and a plug side, and the plug is always Opening Balance
    Equity. A caller computing the plug themselves gets it wrong by a few cents
    on the third entry and the ledger never balances again.
  * **It is flagged as opening.** ERPNext's `is_opening` and the `Opening Entry`
    voucher type are what keep these amounts out of the period's activity in
    reports that separate the two. Nothing warns you when they are missing; the
    P&L simply reads as though the company earned its opening equity in January.
  * **It is one event, not one line.** "The equipment came over from PFI" is six
    asset accounts and one equity line, and it wants one remark explaining the
    whole thing rather than six lines each explaining a sixth of it.

So this takes the real side and computes the plug, and refuses everything that
would make the plug meaningless.

WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT DO. Submit. Like every other tool in this app it produces
a DRAFT — and an opening balance is the single entry most worth a human reading
before it moves a balance, because it is the one nobody will ever re-derive.

AND THE OTHER SHAPE OF THE SAME JOB. `post_opening_balance_journal_entry` is
here too, for the case `set_opening_balance` reads badly: a whole trial balance
transcribed off the previous system, where the caller has both sides already and
wants one entry rather than one per account. Every line is explicit there, the
offset account is named rather than found, and it will post the entry when asked
— which is why it checks `submit_journal_entry`'s switch as well as its own.
Same file because they are the same job seen from two ends, and because the parts
that must not diverge — what a postable account is, what the opening flags are —
are shared functions rather than two copies.

THE OPENING EQUITY ACCOUNT IS FOUND, NOT GUESSED. `3300` by number first, then a
leaf Equity account named after it, and anything other than exactly one match is
refused with the candidates listed. Posting the plug to whichever equity account
sorted first is an error that surfaces months later as an equity statement nobody
can explain.

	"""A whole opening balance sheet as one Journal Entry, optionally posted.

	WHAT THIS IS FOR THAT `set_opening_balance` IS NOT. That tool books one
	*event* — the equipment that came over from PFI — and computes the equity plug
	itself, which is exactly right when the caller knows one side of one fact. It
	is the wrong shape for the other opening-balance job: transcribing a whole
	trial balance off the previous system, where the caller already has both
	sides, already knows they balance, and wants them in one entry rather than
	fourteen. Feeding that through a tool that insists on computing the plug means
	fourteen calls and fourteen equity lines that should have been one.

	So: every line explicit, `offset_account` named rather than found, and one
	balancing line added only if the lines do not already balance. The offset is
	usually Opening Balance Equity and this does not insist on it — a trial
	balance that is out by the retained earnings figure is a real thing to book
	against retained earnings.

	IT CAN SUBMIT, AND THAT IS WHY IT CHECKS TWO SWITCHES. `submit: true` posts
	the entry through `submit_journal_entry`, so `allow_submit_journal_entry` has
	to be on as well as this tool's own switch — and it is checked BEFORE anything
	is written, so an operator who has not enabled posting gets a refusal rather
	than a draft they did not ask for. With `submit` left false this behaves like
	every other tool here and produces a draft.

	IT FILLS IN `debit_in_account_currency`. Every Journal Entry this app writes
	does now; see `tools/mutate.py`. It is called out here because this is the tool
	whose whole job is entries big enough that discovering on submit that they are
