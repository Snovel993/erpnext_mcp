"""The Compliance Command Center: what is due, what is late, and how ready you are.

WHY IT IS A FRAPPE DASHBOARD AND NOT A PAGE THIS APP DRAWS. Everything on it is
a standard `Dashboard`, `Dashboard Chart` and `Number Card`, which means it
renders in the Desk with the site's own theme, respects the reading user's
permissions, drills through to the underlying list view on a click, and keeps
working when Frappe changes its front end. A bespoke page would look better for
one release and be a maintenance liability for every one after it. The landing
page is `/app/compliance-command-center`, which is Frappe's own route for the
dashboard named below and not a route this app registers.

WHY IT IS BUILT BY AN INSTALLER RATHER THAN SHIPPED AS `fixtures`. `test_hooks.py`
forbids the `fixtures` hook by name, and this is exactly why. A fixture is
imported by `bench migrate` with no ability to look at what is already there: an
operator who reordered their cards, changed a colour or deleted a chart they did
not want would get it silently put back on the next migrate, every time, forever.
So this checks before it writes — a card that exists is left alone, including all
the ways somebody has since edited it — and only the ones that are genuinely
missing are created. Re-running is a no-op, which is asserted by a test.

THE READINESS SCORE IS THE ONE NUMBER SOMEBODY ACTS ON. Everything else on the
dashboard is a count, and a count only means something to a person who already
knows what normal looks like. "Eleven open warnings" is not actionable on a
Tuesday in July. `audit_readiness_score` — resolved alerts over all alerts raised,
as a percentage — is comparable to yesterday's, which is the property that makes
a number worth putting on a wall. It is computed in `readiness()` rather than in a
chart, because it is a ratio of two collections and a Number Card can only count
one.

WHAT THE SCORE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: reward dismissing things. A human
dismissal counts as resolved — because somebody looked and decided, and that IS
the work — but the reason is mandatory, and `dismissal_quality` reports how many
of the resolutions were auto-dismissals (the condition genuinely went away)
against human ones. An operation whose score is 95% entirely through dismissals
is a different operation from one whose score is 95% because the work got done,
and the dashboard says which.

NOTHING HERE RAISES — BUT IT REPORTS, AND v0.16.0 PROVED WHY THAT MATTERS. Every
builder here catches its own exceptions into `report["failed"]` and returns. In
v0.16.0 `install.py` then threw the report away, so when the Farm Task Dispatch
Kanban failed to insert on a real site the migration printed nothing, reported
success, and the board simply did not exist. Silence in an installer is not
safety; it is a bug that has been given somewhere to hide. `install.py` now prints
every entry in `failed`, and the two are only useful together.

NOTHING HERE ASSUMES ANOTHER APP'S SELECT OPTIONS, AND THAT IS THE OTHER HALF OF
THE SAME LESSON. `Kanban Board Column.indicator` is Frappe's field, not this
app's, and its option list has changed across the versions this app supports.
v0.16.0 hardcoded `"gray"`; on Tim's site the options were capitalised, the
insert threw, and the swallowed exception did the rest. `_select_value` now reads
the options off the site and matches case-insensitively, and drops the value
entirely when nothing matches — a column with no colour is cosmetic, a board that
does not exist is not. The rule generalises: this app validates its OWN Selects
against its own JSON, and asks the site about everybody else's.

	purpose. That argument holds for every field on these documents except this
	one, because a dict-shaped `filters_json` is not a preference — it is a card
	that raises `TypeError` the moment Frappe tries to draw its comparison arrow,
	and it takes the whole workspace's render down with it.

	So the repair is as narrow as it can be and still work:

	  * ONLY `filters_json`, and only when it parses to a `dict`. A list is either
	    this app's own current output or an operator's, and both are fine.
	  * THE OPERATOR'S OWN CLAUSES ARE CARRIED ACROSS, not replaced with the
	    spec's. Somebody who changed a card to count `Awaiting-Review` instead of
	    `Available` gets a working card counting `Awaiting-Review`. Replacing the
	    filters with this app's would be the fixture behaviour, and it would
	    silently undo their edit under cover of a bug fix.
	  * `document_type` is read off THE DOCUMENT, not the spec, for the same
	    reason — the list shape names the doctype in every clause, and the
	    document knows which doctype it actually counts.

	Never raises: a repair that cannot be made is reported and the migration
	carries on, exactly like every other builder here.
