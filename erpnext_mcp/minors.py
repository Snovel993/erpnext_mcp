"""Who is under eighteen, what that changes, and the citation for each change.

Same contract as `breaks.py`, `bucket_bridge.py` and `payroll_gl.py`: everything
arrives as a value or a dict, nothing writes, nothing imports `frappe`. The
callers — `tools/shifts.add_worker_to_shift`, `tools/dispatch.assign_farm_task`,
`tools/employee.employee_detail`, `tools/hr.list_employees` and the
`minor_hours_approaching` alert rule — do the reading and the refusing; this
module owns the arithmetic and the regulation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`is_minor` IS DERIVED AND IS NEVER STORED
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

There is no `is_minor` column on Employee and there will not be one. A stored
flag is correct on the day somebody ticks it and wrong every day afterwards: a
fifteen-year-old hired in April is sixteen in July and seventeen the following
season, and the one thing a child-labour column must not be is stale in the
direction that permits more work. `date_of_birth` is a fact that does not move;
the answer is computed from it against the day being asked about, which is why
every function here takes an `on_date`.

The other half of the same argument: a farm that does not record a date of birth
gets `None` and NOT `False`. "We do not know" and "they are an adult" are
different answers, and a module that collapsed them would clear a minor onto a
ten-hour shift because a column was empty. `describe` says which of the two it
is, and the callers say so too.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TWO BANDS, BECAUSE THE LAW HAS TWO
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Fourteen and fifteen is a different set of rules from sixteen and seventeen, and
treating "minor" as one category would either forbid lawful work for the older
band or permit unlawful work for the younger. `band()` answers `"under-16"`,
`"16-17"` or `""` (an adult, or somebody too young to be employed at all — see
`MINIMUM_AGE`).

  under-16   OR: 8 h a day, 40 h a week, and 07:00 to 19:00 only.
             ORS 653.315 / OAR 839-021-0220 for the hours; 29 CFR 570.35 for
             the clock, which is the FLSA's own limit on a fourteen- or
             fifteen-year-old outside school hours.
             WA: 8 h a day, 40 h a week, 05:00 to 21:00, six days a week.
             WAC 296-131-120.

  16-17      OR: 10 h a day, 60 h a week, no time-of-day limit in agriculture.
             OAR 839-021-0104. There is no FLSA hours limit on this band in
             agriculture at all; the Oregon ceiling is the binding one, which
             is why it is the number here.
             WA: 10 h a day, FIFTY h a week, 05:00 to 22:00, six days a week.
             WAC 296-131-120 — and the fifty is the one figure in this module
             where Washington binds tighter than Oregon.

AND THE STATE IS PART OF THE ANSWER, WHICH IT WAS NOT UNTIL NOW. Every function
below takes a `work_state`; where none is given they answer from
`strictest_limits()`, the tightest figure across both states, because a table
with no state in its name must not permit what some state forbids. The refusals
built from it say so and name the one argument that fixes it — see `state_note`.

The daily figures are NON-SCHOOL-DAY figures, deliberately. A school-day limit
is three hours (ORS 653.315), and applying it would need this app to know each
worker's school calendar, which it does not and should not — so the ceiling
encoded is the one that holds during harvest, and the refusal says which figure
it used so a foreman rostering during term time can see what was assumed.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT A MINOR MAY NOT BE SENT TO
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

`PROHIBITED_TASK_TYPES` is short, and short on purpose. Every entry names a
regulation that forbids the work by AGE rather than by training, because a list
that also carried "probably unwise" would be a list a foreman learns to override.

  Spray, either band   40 CFR §170.309(c). The 2015 Worker Protection Standard
                       sets a minimum age of EIGHTEEN for pesticide handlers
                       and for early-entry workers. It is not a training gap
                       that can be closed with a course.

  Repair, under-16     29 CFR §570.71(a). The Hazardous Occupations Orders in
                       Agriculture put power-driven machinery — tractors over
                       20 PTO horsepower, balers, augers, power take-offs —
                       out of reach of anybody under sixteen. Repair is where
                       this app's task vocabulary puts that work.

The 16-17 band is NOT barred from Repair, and that is the regulation rather than
an oversight: the HO/A orders bind under-sixteens, and a seventeen-year-old
lawfully runs a tractor on a farm in Oregon.

#:
#: Because the two states genuinely differ, and they differ in BOTH directions —
#: which is what makes a single table wrong rather than merely imprecise:
#:
#:   * Washington's weekly ceiling for a 16- or 17-year-old is FIFTY hours and
#:     Oregon's is sixty. A crew rostered to Oregon's figure in Franklin County
#:     is ten hours a week over a limit this app was telling them they were
#:     inside.
#:   * Washington has a CLOCK for that band — 05:00 to 22:00 — and Oregon has
#:     none at all. A single table either invented an Oregon curfew or dropped
#:     Washington's.
#:
#: The daily figures are NON-SCHOOL-DAY / NON-SCHOOL-WEEK figures in both
#: states, for the reason the module docstring gives: the school-day limits need
#: each worker's school calendar, which this app does not have and should not
#: collect. Every refusal says which figure it used.

#: eight and forty this app has shipped since v0.98.0 under a different
#: citation. Encoding one sentence out of a rule whose other numbers contradict
#: the table above would be picking the half that suits; the discrepancy is
#: written down here so somebody can settle it against counsel rather than
#: against a search result. Until then Oregon carries no days-per-week figure
#: and this app says nothing about it, which is the honest of the two silences.
#:
#: IT IS A WARNING AND NEVER A REFUSAL, wherever it is read. WAC 296-131-120(4)
#: carves out dairy, livestock, hay harvest and irrigation-dependent crop work,
#: and this app does not know which of those a given shift is — so a hard block
#: would be a false refusal on exactly the operations the exception was written
#: for.
