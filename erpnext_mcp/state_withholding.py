"""State withholding calculation engines — PURE FUNCTIONS.

No database reads, no side effects, fully testable with deterministic inputs.

v0.29.0. Oregon and Washington. The critical design decision: wage law follows
WORK LOCATION per shift, not employer HQ. An employee who picks cherries in
Hood River on Monday and in White Salmon on Tuesday owes Oregon tax on Monday's
gross and Washington programs on Tuesday's.

Oregon: income tax (ORS 316.037 brackets), Statewide Transit Tax (0.1%),
Paid Leave Oregon (ORS 657B), Workers' Compensation (employer-entered rate).

Washington: Paid Family & Medical Leave (RCW 50A), WA Cares Fund (RCW 50B),
Labor & Industries (workers' comp, employer-entered rates). NO income tax.

v0.40.0 adds STATE UNEMPLOYMENT (SUTA) to both, and it is employer-entered for
the same reason workers' compensation is: a SUTA rate is assigned to one
employer by one state agency out of that employer's own experience rating, and
there is no table anybody could ship. The rate defaults to ZERO, which means a
site that has not entered one computes exactly what it computed before this
release — the addition is a place to put a number, not a new charge.

It sits beside FUTA rather than inside it on purpose: FUTA is federal, filed on
the 940, and its credit already assumes state unemployment tax was paid. The
two are separate liabilities to separate agencies and they reconcile against
each other, which they cannot do from one account.

# Annual brackets. The engine annualizes gross, looks up the bracket, then
# de-annualizes back to the pay period — same pattern as the federal engine.
#
# THESE ARE SEED DATA, NOT THE TAX TABLE. v0.91.0. No calculation in this module
# reads them: `calculate_oregon_withholding` is handed a bracket list by its
# caller, and on a live site that list comes from the State Tax Table doctype via
# `tools/state_tax._load_state_table`. What these constants are for is
# `seed_or_brackets`, which `install._state_tax_table` inserts once on a site
# whose table is empty — and after that an operator owns the rows.
#
# So a new tax year does NOT come back here. It arrives through
# `import_state_tax_table` with the year's own floors, which is the point of the
# doctype: Oregon publishes its brackets in December and a farm should not need a
# release to withhold correctly in January. What this file still pins is the
# 2025 figures a fresh install starts from, and the year it says they belong to.
