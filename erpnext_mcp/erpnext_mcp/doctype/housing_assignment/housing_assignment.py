"""Controller for Housing Assignment — who slept where, and when.

THE NAME IS `HA-YYYY-MM-<seq>`, SEQUENCED WITHIN THE MONTH. A camp fills up in
the same fortnight every year, so a name carrying the month is a name that sorts
into seasons without a report. The sequence is computed from the rows already in
that month rather than from Frappe's naming series, because the series counter is
global and would leave gaps that read like deleted records in an audit somebody
is defending.

`employee` IS A DATA FIELD, NOT A LINK, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Frappe HR is not
a dependency of this app. A Link to Employee would make the whole doctype fail to
migrate on a site without hrms, which is every site that has not installed it —
so the id is stored as text and validated against the Employee register *when
there is one*. Where hrms is installed the refusal is real: an assignment naming
somebody who is not on file is a roster that has already drifted from payroll.

STATUS IS DERIVED FROM THE DATES, ALWAYS. There is no separate active flag,
because two representations of one fact are two facts that will disagree. Blank
end date means currently assigned; that is the entire occupancy model, and
`get_housing_capacity` counts nothing else.

NOTHING HERE DELETES. An assignment that ended is an assignment that stays. It
is the audit trail defending a Section 119 exclusion, the answer to a wage claim
about a housing deduction, and the roster a food safety investigator asks for.
Ending one writes an end date; it does not remove a row.
