"""Controller for Expense Receipt — what the machine read, and what a person owes.

v0.31.0. A foreman photographs a slip at the pump or the parts counter, on-device
Vision OCR reads the merchant, the total and the date off it, and the phone posts
the lot here. Everything below exists because the extracted fields are a MACHINE'S
READING OF A PHOTOGRAPH and are wrong often enough to plan for.

THE PHOTO AND THE RAW TEXT ARE KEPT BESIDE THE EXTRACTED FIELDS, not instead of
them. `merchant`, `amount` and `receipt_date` are what the app will reimburse
against; `receipt_image` and `ocr_raw_text` are what settles the argument when
somebody says the total was $84.10 and the field says $84.16. Neither is
derivable from the other after the fact, so both are stored.

`ocr_confidence` IS A SORTING KEY, NOT A GATE. A low-confidence receipt is not
invalid — a crumpled thermal slip photographed in the sun reads badly and is
still a real expense. It is a receipt an approver should open the photo for, and
`list_expense_receipts` sorts on it so the doubtful ones surface first. It is
range-checked to 0..1 here because a scanner that reports 87 meant 0.87 and a
field that silently accepts both makes the sort meaningless.

LINE TOTALS ARE DERIVED WHEN THE SCANNER COULD NOT READ THEM, and left alone when
it could. OCR reads line items far less reliably than it reads a bold total, so a
row that has a quantity and a unit price but no total gets the product; a row that
carries its own total keeps it, because a receipt that charges for four at $3 and
totals $11.50 after a discount is telling the truth and the multiplication is not.

THE LINE ITEMS ARE NEVER RECONCILED AGAINST `amount`, deliberately. Tax, tips,
deposits and core charges all live between the lines and the total, and a
validation that demanded they agree would reject most real receipts. The total is
the field that matters; the lines are detail somebody may want later.
