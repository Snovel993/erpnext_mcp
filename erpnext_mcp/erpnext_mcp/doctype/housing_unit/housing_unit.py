"""Controller for Housing Unit — one building on a camp.

THE DOCNAME IS `"<unit name> - <parcel abbr>"`, the same shape a Field takes,
because every camp numbers its cabins from one and "Cabin-01" alone is three
different buildings on this operation.

THE OCCUPANCY LIMIT IS COMPUTED ONCE AND THEN LEFT ALONE. Fifty square feet of
sleeping area per occupant is the federal temporary-labor-camp figure Oregon's
rules are built on, so a unit with a floor area has an answer without anybody
typing one. But it is a *default*, not a derivation: a cabin with a fixed bunk
layout, or one under a local code that says otherwise, gets the number somebody
worked out, and recomputing over the top of that would quietly replace a
considered answer with an arithmetic one.

WHAT THIS REFUSES IS SMALL AND THE REASONS ARE ARITHMETIC. A duplicate unit name
on one parcel, because the docname is built from it. Negative area, capacity or
year. Nothing about condition, nothing about inspection dates — a camp that has
not been walked since 2019 is a fact worth recording, and a controller that
refused to record it would be a controller that guaranteed the record stayed
empty.
