#: `== "Cool-Down"` tests membership here instead.
#:

#: shade, drinking water and cool-down separately REQUIRED — so the log has to

    """Every break this shift owes, and the clock time each one falls due.

    WHY THE SERVER COMPUTES THIS AND NOT THE HANDSET. A break countdown is only
    useful if a crew takes its break together, and a schedule each phone works
    out for itself drifts by whatever the phones disagree about — the shift's
    start time, the device clock, and which policy the app managed to fetch
    before it lost signal. `SERVER_CHANGES.md` §14 puts it as the requirement:
    every phone on the crew has to count down to the same second. This returns
    instants, not durations, so a phone that fetched the schedule an hour late
    still shows the same 10:05 as the one that fetched it at the tailgate.

    `hours` IS THE PLANNED LENGTH OF THE SHIFT AND NOT THE HOURS WORKED SO FAR,
    and the difference decides what is on the list at all. Entitlement bands are
    keyed on the length of the shift — six hours owes a meal, four does not — so
    computing against elapsed time would mean the meal period APPEARS on the
    schedule four hours in, which is three hours after the crew needed to know
    it was coming. A shift already closed is measured end-to-end instead; see
    the caller.

    THE STATUS IS ADVISORY AND THE INSTANT IS THE FACT. `due_at` is fixed the
    moment the shift starts and never moves; `status` and `minutes_until` are
    computed against `now` and are what the countdown bar reads. A break already
    logged is `taken`, in order — the second rest of the day matches the second
    row — because the events carry a kind and not a row number, and pairing them
    by position is what lets a crew that took its first break early still see
    the right time for its second.

    `is_minor` PICKS THE TABLE AND NOTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS FUNCTION CHANGES.
    OAR 839-021-0072 owes a worker under eighteen a rest every two hours and a
    meal every four, against four and six for an adult — so a minor's countdown
    is the same arithmetic over different bands, and `_schedule_key` falls back
    to the adult table where a policy carries no minor rows. `schedule_band` is
    on every row for the same reason `policy_source` is: the handset prints
    "Minor's schedule" beside the countdown, and a badge that claimed a band the
    server did not use would be worse than no badge.

    `policy_source` TRAVELS ON EVERY ROW rather than once at the top, because a
    heat cool-down and a rest period can come off different tables of the same
    record, and a future policy that carried only half a schedule would leave
    the app unable to say which half it was showing. The handset PRINTS this —
    a countdown that looks authoritative but is really the app's own reading of
    OAR 839-020-0050 is the kind of thing somebody quotes in a wage claim.
