"""`fiscal_year_audit_packet` — what an outside CPA asks for on day one.

THE TWO BASES, AND WHY THE PACKET SAYS SO. A trial balance is not one thing.
Balance-sheet accounts (Asset, Liability, Equity) carry forward, so their closing
balance is cumulative from the beginning of the ledger. Profit-and-loss accounts
(Income, Expense) start each year at zero, so theirs is the movement *within* the
year. Mixing the two silently is how a trial balance comes out not balancing and
somebody spends an afternoon on it. Every row here carries its `basis`, and the
debit/credit totals used for the balance check are computed separately, on a
single cumulative basis, where they must agree by construction.

THE ACCOUNTING IDENTITY IS CHECKED. For an unclosed year:

    Assets - (Liabilities + Equity) = Income - Expense

Both sides are computed independently from the same ledger. If they disagree by
more than a cent, something is wrong with the books or with this packet, and
either way it is an ERROR and the packet is not signable. This is the single most
valuable line in the file: it is the check a CPA would do by hand first.

INTERCOMPANY IS FOUND BY LOOKING, NOT BY TRUSTING. A Journal Entry carries a
`company`, but its account lines carry their own — and nothing stops a line
pointing at another company's account. The packet resolves every line's account
to its company and reports any entry that spans more than one, which is the sort
of thing that is invisible until consolidation.
